# 📊 Data Visualization
**Introduction**

🎨 Data Visualization is the process of transforming raw data into visual formats such as charts, graphs, and dashboards to make complex information easier to understand.
It helps analysts and researchers identify trends, patterns, and relationships that might not be apparent in raw numerical data.

# Objectives of Data Visualization

✅ Convert data into meaningful and easy-to-read visuals.
✅ Detect hidden patterns, correlations, and anomalies.
✅ Support decision-making through clear visual storytelling.
✅ Communicate analytical findings effectively to both technical and non-technical audiences.

# Tools Used

🧰 Various visualization tools and libraries are used to create rich and interactive visuals:

🐍 Matplotlib – Used for basic plotting such as line graphs, histograms, and scatter plots.

🌈 Seaborn – Built on Matplotlib; provides beautiful, statistical visualizations like heatmaps and boxplots.

📊 Tableau / Power BI (optional) – Tools for interactive dashboards and business insights visualization.
